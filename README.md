## Documentation

Documentation requires `asciidoctor` with some addons:

    gem install asciidoctor asciidoctor-diagram
    gem install --pre asciidoctor-pdf

Since it contains some diagrams, you also need `plantuml`:

    yum install -y plantuml

Create RPM package with

    python3 setup.py bdist_rpm


## INI file

You must set manager.url and inotifier.path.
* Manager.url is base url for media files.
* Inotifier.url pointing to directory with media files

Final media url is manager.url + file_path_from_intofier_url
